0.1-alpha.6 (Aug 25 2015)
=========================

* tests now run by pytest (#20)
* BaseConfig has been removed so config is plain dictionary (#19)
* update_config is now the default configuration updating function
  (#18). Consequently, the updates of config_default have been
  modified throughout.
